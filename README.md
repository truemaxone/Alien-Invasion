🚀 Alien invasion is a clone of popular arcade game with same name. I created this game by following the "Python Crash Course 2nd edition" book by Eric Matthes and made some upgrades:
* aliens' ships images
* player ship image
* bullets images
* sound effects
* music
* explosion's animations
* background's animation
* aliens attack player

The reason of developing was to improve my python skills.

🗿 **Description**

In Alien Invasion, the player controls a ship that appears at the bottom center of the screen. The player can move the ship right and left using the arrow keys and shoot bullets using the spacebar. When the game begins, a fleet of aliens' ships fills the sky and moves across and down the screen and sometimes shoot in you. The player shoots and destroys the aliens. If the player shoots all the aliens' ships, a new fleet appears that moves faster than the previous fleet. If the player misses he looses 10 points. If any alien hits the player's ship or reaches the bottom of the screen, the player loses a ship. If the player loses three ships, the game ends.

🎮 **Controls**

* Space bar: Shoot

* Arrow keys (⬅ ➡): Move left/right
